# Musa Capital

Welcome to the Musa Capital Open Cap Table Management Tool project! This project provides tools for emerging funds, solo GPs, law firms, and angel syndicates. This README file contains detailed instructions on how to install, debug, and submit your code changes in adherence to our coding standards.

6. [License](#license)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/musacapital.git
   cd musacapital
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables. Example:
   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the application, run:
```sh
node app.js
```
The server should start on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is 3000).

## Debugging

To debug the application, follow these steps:

1. **Use a debugger:**
   You can use Node.js built-in debugger or an IDE like Visual Studio Code.

2. **Start the application in debug mode:**
   ```sh
   node --inspect app.js
   ```
   This will start the application and listen for debugging connections. You can open `chrome://inspect` in Chrome to connect to the debugger.

3. **Add breakpoints:**
   Add `debugger` statements in your code where you want to pause execution and inspect variables.

## Submitting Changes

Follow these steps to submit your code changes:

1. **Create a new branch:**
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/{story-id}  # For features
   git checkout -b bug/{story-id}      # For bugs
   git checkout -b chore/{story-id}    # For chores
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   Ensure your code follows the coding standards (see below).

3. **Write failing tests:**
   Write tests that demonstrate the functionality is NOT already present. Make a WIP commit:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "WIP: Red Tests."
   ```

4. **Implement code to pass the tests:**
   Make WIP commits as you go, and commit code when your tests are green:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "WIP: Green Tests."
   ```

5. **Refactor your code:**
   Refactor to improve code quality. Re-run the tests and commit:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Refactor complete."
   ```

6. **Submit a pull request:**
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/{story-id}  # Push your branch
   ```

   Go to the repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch.

7. **Review process:**
   Review outstanding pull requests, comment on, approve and merge open pull requests, or request changes on any PRs that need improvement.

## Coding Standards

Please follow these coding standards to maintain code quality and consistency:

1. **Indentation:**
   Use 4 spaces for indentation.

2. **Naming Conventions:**
   - Variables and functions: camelCase
   - Classes and components: PascalCase
   - Constants: UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE

3. **Comments:**
   - Use JSDoc style comments for functions and classes.
   - Provide meaningful comments for complex code segments and functions.
   - Document any public APIs and classes with clear explanations of their purpose and usage.
   - Remove or update outdated comments as code changes.

4. **Code Structure:**
   - Organize code into modules and components.
   - Keep functions small and focused on a single task.

5. **Linting:**
   Ensure your code passes ESLint checks:
   ```sh
   npm run lint
   ```

6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests using BDD-style frameworks like Mocha or Jasmine.
   - Follow the Arrange, Act, and Assert (AAA) pattern:
     ```javascript
     it('should correctly add two positive numbers', () => {
       // Arrange
       const num1 = 5;
       const num2 = 7;

       // Act
       const result = add(num1, num2);

       // Assert
       expect(result).to.equal(12);
     });
     ```

   - Write integration tests to validate interactions between different parts of the application.
   - Write functional tests to validate the application's functionality.
